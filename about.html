    <h1>About this Dollmaker</h1>
This is a dollmaker for creating sprites for use with Renpy and other visual novel engines, or just for fun. 
It is currently a very early alpha build and super unreliable! Saves made now will definitely break in later releases. 
</p>
<p>Please let me know if you hit any bugs or if there's any extra features you'd like, though I make no guarantees.
<h2>Possible Future Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Wheelchair option</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Occasional flicker while image is updating</li>
    <li>Sometimes fills the image with colour when stubble is randomly generated. If you reset the facial hair this fixes itself.</li>
    <li>Colours sometimes take a second or two to 'catch up' to the right value.</li>
    <li>Import and right-click-save don't work on all browsers. Chrome and Firefox seem to be ok.</li>
    <li>Colour picker is sometimes slightly off.</li>
</ul>
